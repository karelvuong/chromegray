# Chromegray

A Chrome DevTools theme based on @kkga's Spacegray Sublime Text 2/3 UI theme and @chriskempson's base16 Ocean colour scheme.

**A couple notes:**
*  This is an unofficial theme and can break the functionality of Chrome Developer Tools.
*  This is still a work in progress.
*  At the moment, there is only support for Chrome Stable v. 31.0.1650.57 m.
*  Support for the Chrome Canary will be coming soon.
